          WE ARE FASHION REVOLUTION We campaign for a clean, safe, fair,
          transparent and accountable fashion industry. We do this through
          research, education, collaboration, mobilisation and advocacy. The
          issues in the fashion industry never fall on any single person, brand,
          or company. Thatâ€™s why we focus on using our voices to transform the
          entire system. With systemic and structural change, the fashion
          industry can lift millions of people out of poverty and provide them
          with decent and dignified livelihoods. It can conserve and restore our
          living planet. It can bring people together and be a great source of
          joy, creativity and expression for individuals and communities. We
          believe in a global fashion industry that conserves and restores the
          environment and values people over growth and profit.
